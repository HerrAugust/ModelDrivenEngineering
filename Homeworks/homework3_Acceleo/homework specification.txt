Consider the meta model given for the Homework 2 (file Model-Driven Engineering\homework3\homework3_EMF\model\EMFWebApplication2.ecore), define different ACCELEO templates such that:
1. for each <<Page>> an HTML page must be generated with the corresponding <<Contents>> and <<Links>>
2. for each <<Entity> a corresponding MySQL Table must be create and queried


HOW CAN I RUN IT?
1. Download Eclipse
2. Download all the needed plugins listed in the root of this repository
3. Import the project homework3_EMF
4. Import the project homework3_Acceleo
5. homework3_Acceleo/src/*.main/generate.mtl -> right click -> Launch Acceleo Application and configure referencing the model (.xmi) inside homeowork3_EMF/model
6. See generated file in the folder you chose during configuration (step 5). Mine is homework3_Acceleo/results
