# ModelDrivenEnineering
Projects for Model Driven Engineering (2017)

Moreover, homeworks are included. They are about Acceleo, EMF, grammars and so on.

## Run JointJS
download the repository and then simply open index.html or one of the other HTML files.

## Run the homeworks
1. Downloads all the plugins in Homeworks/LOOKATME_What to install for this projects.PNG
2. Then, Open one of the projects with Eclipse and just run the one that you prefer.

The most important one is maybe **"homework5"**. Here, the aim is to print in a particular form (text) all possible .ecore (metamodels) that the user wants. This is done in Acceleo using the metametamodel ECore because all metamodels conform to ECore. Then, some Java methods (see C:\Users\agost\Documents\workspace\ModelDrivenEngineering\Homeworks\homework5\org.eclipse.acceleo.module.sample\src\org\eclipse\acceleo\module\sample\utility\Utility.java and utility.mtl; also notice the dependency in ModelDrivenEngineering\Homeworks\homework5\org.eclipse.acceleo.module.sample\META-INF\MANIFEST.MF) are used inside the main MTL (Acceleo transformation, see \ModelDrivenEngineering\Homeworks\homework5\org.eclipse.acceleo.module.sample\src\org\eclipse\acceleo\module\sample\main\generate.mtl).  
An example of result is shown in ModelDrivenEngineering\Homeworks\homework5\org.eclipse.acceleo.module.sample\res\intermediate_repr.txt
